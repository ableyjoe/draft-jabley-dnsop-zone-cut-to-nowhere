              Signalling a Zone Cut to Nowhere in the DNS
             draft-jabley-dnsop-zone-cut-to-nowhere-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a standard means to signal that a zone cut
   exists in the DNS without specifying a set of nameservers to which a
   child zone is delegated.  This is useful in situations where it is
   important to make it clear to clients that a zone cut exists, but
   when the child zone is only provisioned in a private namespace.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS protocol, as originally specified in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035],
   describes a single, global, hierarchical namespace that is separated
   into zones.  The boundary between a parent zone and a child zone is
   indicated using a zone cut.  Zone cuts are specified using specific
   resource records which are published within the parent and child
   zones, and are revealed during DNS resolution by referral responses
   from nameservers.

   Private namespaces also exist in the DNS.  A user of a private
   network might be able to resolve names using local DNS infrastructure
   that are not visible to other users of other networks.  This is often
   an intentional and deliberate configuration by network operators.
   For example to provide name resolution for internal, private services
   that are not available to users of other networks.

   When a device or application uses the DNS protocol to resolve both
   internal names and external names published in the global DNS
   namespace, ambiguity can result.  For example, DNS responses from
   Internet-reachable nameservers might indicate that a particular name
   published in an internal namespace does not exist, while an internal
   nameserver might be configured to respond differently.  Since mobile
   devices can attach to different networks and can cache DNS responses
   obtained from different namespaces, this ambiguity can cause
   headaches.  A DNSSEC-aware resolver on a mobile device might cache a
   signed, negative response from an external nameserver for a
   particular name, for example, and might treat a subsequent positive
   response from an internal nameserver for the same name as bogus,
   preventing the response from being used by an application.

   This document provides a means of signalling the existence of a zone
   cut in a namespace which does not include the corresponding child
   zone, in order to eliminate this ambiguity.  We refer to this type of
   zone cut as a "zone cut to nowhere" and introduce the corresponding
   terms "delegation to nowhere" and "referral to nowhere" that are
   defined in Section 2.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses DNS terminology as described in [RFC9499].
   Familiarity with terms defined in that document is assumed.

   This document also uses the following terms which are not thought to
   be in common usage.

   1.  "Zone cut to nowhere" -- a zone cut (q.v.) where the parent zone
       and the child zone are provisioned in different namespaces.  A
       zone cut to nowhere is a signal provided by the administrator of
       a parent zone that a child zone exists, but is not able to be
       used in the DNS namespace of the parent.

   2.  "Delegation to nowhere" -- a delegation (q.v.) from a parent to a
       child across a zone cut to nowhere.

   3.  "Referral to nowhere", "Referral response to nowhere" -- a DNS
       response (q.v.) received from a nameserver that reveals the
       existence of a delegation to nowhere.

3.  Publishing a Delegation to Nowhere

   A zone cut to nowhere is implemented in a parent zone using a single
   NS resource record with an empty target (an empty NSDNAME, using the
   terminology of [RFC1035]).  A zone cut to nowhere between the parent
   zone EXAMPLE.ORG and the child zone CHILD.EXAMPLE.ORG with a TTL of
   3600 seconds would be described in zone file syntax as follows:

   ; zone data published in an external nameserver
   $ORIGIN EXAMPLE.ORG.

   ; the zone CHILD.EXAMPLE.ORG exists, but in another namespace
   CHILD  3600  IN  NS  .

   A zone cut to nowhere may also be provisioned as a secure delegation.
   This allows a DNSSEC-aware consumer of a referral response to obtain
   and cache a DNSSEC trust anchor for the child zone, for use when it
   is able to receive a signed response from a nameserver that includes
   the child zone in its namespace.

           $ORIGIN EXAMPLE.ORG.

           ; the signed zone CHILD.EXAMPLE.ORG exists,
           ; but in another namespace

           CHILD  3600  IN  DS  [...]
           CHILD            NS  .

   An NS RRSet in a parent zone which includes multiple NS resource
   records is not a delegation to nowhere, even if the target of one of
   the NS resource records within the RRSet has an empty target
   (NSDNAME).  That NS resource record has no meaning in as a member of
   a broader RRSet and serves no obvious, useful purpose.  However, such
   a configuration MAY exist, and is not specifically not prohibited by
   this specification.

4.  Interpreting a Referral to Nowhere

   No special processing is necessary in order to interpret a referral
   response to nowhere.  Individual RRSets present in a referral
   response to nowhere can safely be interpreted and processed in an
   identical fashion to any other referral response where the
   authoritative servers for the child zone cannot themselves be
   resolved, and hence cannot be reached.

5.  Applicability

   When a child zone is known to exist in another namespace, and when
   that other namespace is intended for use with the DNS, a delegation
   to nowhere MAY be provisioned in the global DNS namespace to signal
   that the private namespace exists.

   A secure delegation to nowhere MAY be provisioned in the global DNS
   namespace if the child zone exists in another namespace and the keys
   used for signing in the child zone are known to the administrator of
   the parent zone.  In the case where different child zones are known
   to exist in multiple, separately-administered namespaces, a secure
   delegation MUST NOT be used.

   A delegation to nowhere MAY be provisioned in any zone.

   The use of a delegation to nowhere in this document is described for
   DNS resource records, queries and responses using the IN class only.

6.  Examples

6.1.  Internal Namespace as a Subdomain of a Public Domain

   A company uses names within the EXAMPLE.COM domain both for internal
   services it provides to its employees and for public services that
   are made available to the general public over the Internet.

   The company also provides certain services that are only available to
   users of devices attached to its internal network.  Those services
   are named within the subdomain CORP.EXAMPLE.COM.  The company does
   not wish those internal services to be visible to external users.

   We say that the EXAMPLE.COM zone exists in the global DNS namespace
   and that the CORP.EXAMPLE.COM zone exists only in a private DNS
   namespace.

   The company publishes a CORP.EXAMPLE.COM zone on DNS nameservers
   attached to its internal network.  The company configures the DNS
   resolvers used by devices attached to its internal network to be
   aware that the CORP.EXAMPLE.COM zone is served by those internal
   nameservers, such that queries sent from devices inside the company's
   network can resolve names in the CORP.EXAMPLE.COM domain.

         $ORIGIN CORP.EXAMPLE.COM.
         ; internal zone only served in our internal network

         @      3600  IN  SOA   [...]

         ; the internal zone CORP.EXAMPLE.COM is served by the internal
         ; nameservers NS1.CORP.EXAMPLE.COM and NS2.CORP.EXAMPLE.COM

                      NS    NS1
                      NS    NS2

         NS1          A     192.168.1.37
                      AAAA  2001:db8:2:1::2c

         NS2          A     192.168.3.56
         NS2          AAAA  2001:db8:2:3::2d

         ; the internal intranet web server is INTRANET.CORP.EXAMPLE.COM

         INTRANET     A     192.168.1.74
                      AAAA  2001:db8:2:1::f8

         ; the management address of an internal network device known
         ; as BACKBONE-SW.CORP.EXAMPLE.COM

         BACKBONE-SW  A     192.168.2.65

   The company publishes an EXAMPLE.COM zone on nameservers that are
   general reachable over the Internet -- that is, the nameservers are
   reachable and the COM zone returns referrals for the EXAMPLE.COM zone
   to those nameservers.  The EXAMPLE.COM zone includes names that the
   company wants clients to be able to resolve regardless of what
   network they are connected to.

          $ORIGIN EXAMPLE.COM.

          ; the public zone EXAMPLE.COM is published to the Internet

          @      3600  IN  SOA   [...]

          ; the public zone EXAMPLE.COM is served by the nameservers
          ; NS1.EXAMPLE.COM and NS2.EXAMPLE.COM which are reachable
          ; over the Internet

                       NS    NS1
                       NS    NS2

          ; Internet mail for EXAMPLE.COM is handled by the server
          ; MAIL.EXAMPLE.COM

                       MX    10 MAIL.EXAMPLE.COM.

          ; The public nameservers NS1.EXAMPLE.COM and NS2.EXAMPLE.COM

          NS1          A     192.0.2.25
          NS1          AAAA  2001:db8:e0::2a

          NS2          A     192.0.2.27
          NS2          AAAA  2001:db8:e0::2b

          ; MAIL.EXAMPLE.COM and WWW.EXAMPLE.COM are intended to be used
          ; from anywhere, not just by internal clients, so they are
          ; named in the global namespace

          MAIL         A     192.0.2.41
          MAIL         A     2001:db8:e0::f1

          WWW          A     192.0.2.58
          WWW          AAAA  2001:db8:e0::5e

          ; CORP.EXAMPLE.COM is our internal namespace. Delegate the
          ; corresponding zone to nowhere

          CORP         NS    .

6.2.  General Purpose Top-Level Domain for Internal Namespaces

   Suppose it has been decided that the top-level domain INTERNAL be
   reserved for use in private namespaces.  The root zone of the global
   DNS is signed using DNSSEC [RFC4033]; that is, DNSSEC-specific RRSets
   are published in the root zone that allow DNSSEC-aware resolvers to
   be sure with cryptographic certainty whether particular top-level
   domains exist in the public namespace.

   A delegation to nowhere for the INTERNAL top-level domain in the root
   zone of the global DNS namespace would provide an unambiguous signal
   to resolvers that INTERNAL does exist in other namespaces.  An
   insecure delegation to nowhere is appropriate in this example since
   there is no single trust anchor that could be used to provide a
   secure delegation to zones in multiple namespaces that have
   different, non-cooperating administrators.

           $ORIGIN .

           ; the INTERNAL top-level domain is delegated to nowhere, to
           ; facilitate its use in private namespaces

           INTERNAL  172800  IN  NS  .

7.  Updates to RFC 1035

   This document updates [RFC1035] section 3.3.11 as follows:

      NSDNAME MAY be specified as a single, empty label to indicate that
      a zone cut exists but that the authoritative nameservers for the
      child zone are not specified.

8.  Other Uses of the Empty Name in the DNS

   In [RFC7505] an MX resource record with an empty target (called
   EXCHANGE in [RFC1035]) is specified to mean that the corresponding
   domain name does not accept e-mail.  In effect, the empty field is
   used to indicate that there is no host available to use for e-mail
   delivery.

9.  Operational Considerations

   The empty name is not known to have been widely used as an NS target,
   although it has been used as an MX target, as described in Section 8.
   It is a reasonable concern that if delegations to nowhere became
   prevalent, or if names related to such zone cuts were associated with
   significant traffic, some operational problem might result.  For
   example, DNS software that made incompatible assumptions about DNS
   responses might fail, or unwanted traffic to root servers might
   result.

   Some experiments carried out by the authors to assess the likelihood
   of such problems are described in Appendix A.  The results of those
   experiments do not suggest that the widespread use of delegations to
   nowhere would lead to operational problems.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document provides a means for both internal and global
   namespaces to be provisioned using DNSSEC, allowing a DNSSEC-aware,
   mobile resolver to maintain a consistent chain of trust regardless of
   whether a private, child namespace exists from it's particular
   vantage point.  The ability to support this configuration cleanly has
   better security properties than configurations that are ambiguous.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   The example of the designated top-level domain INTERNAL being
   provisioned as a delegation of INTERNAL to nowhere from the root zone
   was intentionally chosen in order to make it clear that such a
   configuration is allowed, is consistent with this specification and
   facilitates the use of private namespaces named under such a top-
   level domain with less ambiguity than might otherwise occur.  This
   document does not provide any operational direction to the IANA,
   however.

   The authors stand ready to acknowledge all contributions from their
   friends and colleagues.

   The phrase "delegation to nowhere" was inspired by a misremebered
   title of a novel by Tim Powers entitled "Two Days to Nowhere", in
   which characters deal with ambiguous realities by way of supernatural
   sensitivity, time travel and alcohol.  This seemed like a good
   metaphor for the problem of provisioning overlapping namespaces in
   the DNS.  Unfortunately, it appears that Tim Powers wrote no such
   book, although he did publish the novel "Three Days to Never"
   [Powers2006] and many of his novels do feature ambiguity, the
   supernatural and excessive drinking.  Memory is a tricky thing.  The
   song "Road to Nowhere" [Byrne1985] from the 1985 Talking Heads album
   "Little Creatures" would perhaps have been a better inspiration for
   the terminology.  It's a shame that's not what happened.
